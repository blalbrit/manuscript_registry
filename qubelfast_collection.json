"description": "A selection of medieval manuscripts from the Brett Collection. There are approximately 30 medieval fragments in the collection in total. The medieval section of the Brett Collection consists of a variety of material, mainly of antiquarian interest, including books, extracts, manuscript, and other documents relating principally to early English civil and ecclesiastical law, land and/ or property in Yorkshire, c.1220 - c. 1600. The collection was donated by Belfast solicitor, Sir Charles Brett (1839-1926), to the University Library on 20 June 1924. It was purchased by Sir Charles Brett on 29 March 1886 at Belfast (J.H. Smyth & Co., Auctioneers). http://digital-library.qub.ac.uk/digital/collection/p15979coll17",
